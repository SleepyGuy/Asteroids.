- Add post build command to copy models folder into debug		[DONE]

To do #2: [DONE]

Load all the player models (ships) at the start of the game:
	
	- Make vector class to store points											[DONE]
	- Make ship class to store a vector of 2D vector (if it is already made)	[DONE]
	- Use list file func to read files											[DONE]
	- Store each file content into a ship										[DONE]
	- Store all ship models into "app"											[DONE]

To do #3:

		*Make const velocity*								[DONE]

To do #4:

Make ship rotation and limits (ships goes out screen and appear in the contrary side)

	- Make rotation																						[DONE]
		*Make initial angle when the ship is created													[DONE]
		*Create use const rotating for all direction													[DONE]
		*glRotatef(), is the one who makes the rotation (research)										[DONE]
		*Angle offset is 90º, need to tranform into radians (research polar coordinates)				[DONE]
	- Make limits
		*Calculate borders or limits whatever															[DONE]
		*Calculate inverted current position of the ship when it is entirely out of the view port		[DONE]
		*Assign inverted position to current															[DONE]
